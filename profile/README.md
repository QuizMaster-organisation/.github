# Welcome to QuizMaster!

Welcome to the QuizMaster-Organisation! We are a dedicated team of developers, educators, and quiz enthusiasts committed to creating the best open-source quiz platform and tools. We are using this organisation as a version for the public, while our main development is happening on [hermonochy's](https://github.com/hermonochy/QuizMaster) account.

## Our Projects

### 1. QuizMaster App

- **QuizMaster App** is our flagship project - a powerful and flexible quiz application that allows users to create, and play quizzes on various topics, in various ways! It features a user-friendly interface, real-time scoring, and customizable quiz formats.

### 2. QuizMasterMini

- **QuizMasterMini** is a smaller version of QuizMaster. Some players may be on a budget with storage capabilities or processing power, so we have created a seperate repository for a smaller version, totalling only 8 MB and with no dependencies!
